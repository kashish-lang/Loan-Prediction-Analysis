# Loan-Prediction-Analysis
This project explores a loan prediction dataset to uncover the key factors that influence loan approvals in the banking sector. It combines Python-based EDA, statistical testing, and interactive Tableau visualizations to derive meaningful business insights.

 Key Objectives:

    Understand patterns behind approved vs. rejected loan applications

    Identify the impact of credit history, income, and demographics

    Perform statistical tests like Chi-square, T-test, and ANOVA

    Build an interactive Tableau dashboard for stakeholder storytelling

 Tools Used:

    Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy)

    SQL (for basic aggregation & joins)

    Tableau (Dashboard & Story)

 Key Insights:

    Applicants with positive credit history are significantly more likely to get approved

    Higher total income improves approval chances but is not the only factor

    EMI and loan amount play a key role in filtering high-risk applicants

    Demographics like gender or education have limited influence

 Deliverables:

    Cleaned and feature-engineered dataset

    Statistical hypothesis testing notebook

    Tableau dashboard and story with filters and navigation

    Summary of insights and business recommendations
